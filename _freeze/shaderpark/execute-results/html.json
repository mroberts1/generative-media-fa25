Sometimes not having enough money is good, because you don’t end up throwing a million dollars at a five-cent idea. But \\[what\\] if the idea doesn’t require any money? How do you actually stop yourself from putting too much into an idea that’s too small? You find an external system. And some of the best systems in the world come out of physics, the sciences.

Students are expected to allocate sufficient time to complete all the requirements for each module: reading, viewing, responding to discussion questions, submitting replies to classmates, and completing other assignments on time. Failure to keep up with the pace of the course may result in lower grades or the failure of the class.\n\n**Academic Honesty**\\\nDo not plagiarize. Plagiarism is using someone else’s work without giving them fair credit. Plagiarism and cheating will result in an “F” for the assignment.\n\n**Accommodations**\\\nEmerson is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations, so that each student may fully participate in the Emerson experience. Student Accessibility Services (SAS) staff will be working remotely for the fall of 2020. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please contact them at [*SAS\\@emerson.edu*](mailto:SAS@emerson.edu) or at (617)824-8592 to make an appointment with an SAS staff member.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact SAS early in the semester. Please note that accommodations are not applied retroactively.\n\n**Plagiarism Statement**\\\nIt is the responsibility of all Emerson students to know and adhere to the College’s policy on plagiarism, which can be found at: [*http://www.emerson.edu/policy/plagiarism*](http://www.emerson.edu/policy/plagiarism)\\*. If you have any question concerning the Emerson plagiarism policy or about documentation of sources in work you produce in this course, speak to your instructor.\n\n**Diversity Statement**\\\nEvery student in this class will be honored and respected as an individual with distinct experiences, talents, and backgrounds. Students will be treated fairly regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identification, disability, socio-economic status, or national identity. Issues of diversity may be a part of class discussion, assigned material, and projects. The instructor will make every effort to ensure that an inclusive environment exists for all students. If you have any concerns or suggestions for improving the classroom climate, please do not hesitate to speak with the course instructor or to contact the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at 617-824-8528 or by email at [*diversity*inclusion\\@emerson.edu\\*](mailto:diversity*inclusion@emerson.edu)\n",
