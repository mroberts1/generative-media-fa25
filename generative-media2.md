### Generative Media: History, Theory, Practice

The concept of “generative” media has today become synonymous with generative AI, from chatbots to image and music synthesis. 

Although the term “generative” is today often treated as synonymous with AI-based artistic practices, generative art and aesthetics long predates the digital era, with antecedents that include the experiments with musical chance of John Cage and Lamonte Young, the early computational art of the 1960s, fractal images and music in the 1970s,  or the ambient music of Brian Eno. The popularization of algorithmic tools that enable images, music, literary works, animation, and motion graphics to be generated from text and image prompts, however, has led to a surge in interest in code-based and algorithmic forms of creativity, along with debates about the aesthetic and ethical legitimacy of AI-generated artworks and other creative content. While computational art has been able to pass as human since the 1960s, the current explosive growth of algorithmic tools has rekindled aesthetic debates about the technological dimension of art and the relationship of art to the human more generally.

This course explores the history of generative approaches in the media arts, as well as changing social attitudes towards these and the contemporary debate swirling around “AI art.” In addition to historical examples and philosophical dimensions, students are introduced to a variety of generative approaches to artistic creativity, and collaborate on producing generative artworks in a medium of their choice using a variety of tools, frameworks, and platforms.
