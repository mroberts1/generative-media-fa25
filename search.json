    "section": "",
    "text": "Readings:\n\nDavid Welch, “The Conquest of the Masses” (PDF)\nUmberto Eco, “Towards a Semiological Guerrilla Warfare” (PDF)\n\nWhere to begin?\nOn the most fundamental level, the field of media today can be described as a site of struggle—or more accurately, as a multiplicity of sites of struggle: struggles over the representation and interpretation of real-world events; struggles over identity and whose voices are heard (and whose not); struggles over the political use of media, whether as a tool of corporate or state control, or resistance to it; struggles over ownership and property rights; struggles over media ethics; struggles over creativity and aesthetics; struggles over the environmental impact of media and communication technologies, and many more.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, today’s digital, networked media technologies and social media platforms are sites of struggle over meaning: over the often multiple, often contradictory meanings of media texts, practices, or rituals. The task of media criticism arguably begins with the question of meaning: what certain forms of cultural or media expression mean to different publics and audiences, and how meaning itself is not inherent or self-evident, but socially constructed by the often contradictory interpretations of different communities.\nWithin this larger, continually evolving field of meaning-making, media criticsm involves the analysis and decoding of media texts within specific interpretative frameworks, some of which we will be exploring in this course. They are drawn from a multiplicity of fields of knowledge in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics (semiotics) (Eco 1986), literary theory (narrative), political economy (Marxism), psychoanalysis, social theory, feminism (Negra and Tasker 2007), ethnography, and cultural studies (Hall 1980).\nThe fact that the interpretations of the same media texts are frequently contradictory doesn’t mean that they are equivalent in value in a relativistic way. On the contrary, many of the historical and still ongoing struggles over media meangings are struggles over power—over whose media practice, whose interpretation, is the dominant or valid one. It is often the practices and intrepretations of the most dominant groups within a society, or between societies, that are held to be the most valid ones. But resistant intrepretations and practices are always present, even when repressed, and may challenge or destabilize those of dominant socio-political groups.\nA Contemporary Example: Ghiblification\nIf all this sounds very abstract, it is useful to begin with a concrete example that exemplifies many of the preceding points. The example that I propose we consider this week is a very recent media practice that first emerged last spring (2025) and quickly became a site of struggle in all of the ways described above. It relates to generative AI—already in itself a huge site of struggle over the past few years—and specifically the upgrade to OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool last spring that introduced a new affordance that quickly became nothing less than a global media phenomenon: the ability to convert any photograph into the distinctive visual style of the globally popular Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, using only a simple textual request (e.g. “Convert this into a still from a Studio Ghibli movie”). As with all of meme culture, many of the hundreds (probably thousands) of images generated quickly spread across social media platforms.\nI expect that all of you may have come across the phenomenon at the time, since it was so ubiquitous, but you may have been less aware of its scale and the controversies sparked by many of the practices that emerged from it. In case you missed it, though, and to get a sense of the scale of the phenomenon, take a look at this slideshow that I put together at the time.\nAmong the wildfire of controversies generated by the AI-Ghibli phenomenon, perhaps the most unexpected–often shocking–was its use use in political and indeed geopolitical contexts. To the outcry of many, even the White House appropriated the trend as part of its clampdown on immigration by posting a Ghiblified image on its official Instagram feed. But this was not an isolated event: take a look at this Twitter thread about the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nAs you can see from the initial posts on the thread, it appears that the posting of Ghiblified photographs relating to the Gaza conflict was initiated by the Israeli Defence Force, but if you continue scrolling you will see that the practice was also used by pro-Palestinian or anti-Zionist sources. Just scrolling through this feed alone, I think you can see what I meant earlier by describing media as a site of struggle.\nWhile this may seem like a particularly complex example, I would argue that it’s actually quite typical of the complexities of contemporary media culture and the challenges it poses to the analysis of that culture. Within meme culture alone, one need only consider the strange afterlife of the Pepe The Frog meme, which was the subject of the documentary Feels Good Man (dir. Arthur Jones, 2020). If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend that you watch it, as it’s extremely relevant to our course!\nAs a cultural and political practice, media criticism sets out to make sense of all of this. How does it do this? What kinds of frameworks would enable us to understand examples such as the AI-Ghibli phenomenon or the alt-right’s political appropriation of the Pepe The Frog meme in the lead-up to the 2016 US election? Who would have thought that the charming visual style of Studio Ghibli’s much-loved films, many directed by the self-professed pacifist Hayao Miyazaki, would be appropriated as what appears to be a contemporary form of propaganda? Why would the White House, the IDF, or other political actors appropriate that style? What are they trying to communicate by doing so? I leave you to consider such questions, and am curious to hear what you think.\nIf you were wondering, then, why I assigned you to read one of the early chapters from Welch (1993) study of propaganda in the Third Reich, or Eco (1986) chapter on what he calls “semiological guerrilla warfare”, then by now you may have a better understanding why. Even though Eco’s concept dates from the early 1980s, the AI-Ghibli images amply demonstrate that the age of social media, still several decades away at the time, is today very much a field of semiological guerrilla warfare—not just a war in the human sense but also a war of signs: the signs in question being the existing global cultural mythology of Studio Ghibli itself, which is appropriated in different contexts and for different political purposes as a kind of second-order ideological language. This appropriation of an existing corpus of signs within (global) culture is one of the fundamental practices of what Barthes (1972) called “Mythologies” in his 1957 book of the same name: the process by which ideology presents itself as “normal” or “natural” rather than historical and dependent on highly unequal political, economic, and social dynamics.\nA wider question raised by the examples I’ve been discussing are about the nature of propaganda itself. What exactly is “propaganda”? Welch (1993) offers some useful starting points for reflecting on this subject, and its relevance to contemporary geopolitical contexts. If you’re interested in exploring this subject further, you’ll certainly need to watch Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will (1935), regarded as the classic text of the Nazi propaganda machine. It still makes for chilling viewing today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarthes, Roland. 1972. Mythologies. Translated by Annette Lavers.

You will learn how to become critical of the media messages you use and create, and how to think and write with agency.\nThere are two components of this course:\n\nA survey of such critical approaches/methods as semiotics (Eco 1986; Barthes 1972), psychoanalysis, genre studies, feminist theories (Negra and Tasker 2007), cultural studies (Hall 1980), and postmodernism (Baudrillard 1994; Jameson 1991);\nThe application of these approaches to examining and critiquing various media forms and contents. We will spend a major part of this semester building up theoretical/methodological foundation while devoting the remaining to the critique and analysis of specific media texts and contexts.\n\nThrough extensive reading, writing, class discussion and screening, you will begin to develop the ability to analyze and critique popular media messages and images (Mulvey 1975), as well as develop a critical worldview informed by contemporary media theory (Fisher 2009)."

    "text": "Course Structure and Requirements\nSchedule\nThe course begins on Wednesday 2 July and ends on Tuesday 19 August. Each week of the course accordingly begins on a Wednesday and ends on the following Tuesday.\nLectures, Discussion Forums, and Weekly Response Posts\nEach week, I will post a lecture, either in textual or video format, usually by Friday of the week in question.\nIn the lecture, I will assume that you have done the reading assignments for the week, so make sure to complete them before reading (or watching) the lecture.\nThe lecture will typically introduce some relevant examples relating to the readings that we can use as a starting point for the week’s discussion. However, you are also very welcome to suggest examples of your own that may come to mind after reading the course materials and the lecture.\nEach week, your initial Response post is due no later than the last day of the week in question (i.e. Tuesday in this case). You are then required to post at least 2 follow-up responses to any other group members’ posts (or my own) during the subsequent week. The Discussion cycle for each weekly topic therefore extends over two weeks:\n\nBy the end of the first week (Tuesday): initial response post\nBy the end of second week (the following Tuesday): min. 2 follow-ups to other people’s posts\n\nDon’t sweat too much about meeting exact requirements for post length and frequency! The purpose is for us to have a lively, productive discussion of each week’s readings so keep that as your main goal. Forums will also stay open beyond the biweekly cycle so you can catch up with posts later if you have time.\nAssigned Readings\nPlan on reading every assignment as listed on the course calendar. Since the reading will both inform and enhance material covered during class, please complete the reading assignments prior to watching the lecture videos.\nAttendance and Participation\nFull participation in class discussions and timely submission of all assignments constitutes evidence of class attendance. Students are expected to allocate sufficient time to complete all the requirements for each module: reading, viewing, responding to discussion questions, submitting replies to classmates, and completing other assignments on time. Failure to keep up with the pace of the course may result in lower grades or the failure of the class.\nDiscussion Forums and Weekly Response Posts\nEach week you are required to post a response of approximately 100-250 words to the course readings and/or the weekly lecture. The purpose of this assignment is for you to reflect on lectures, reading assignments or media clips and to pose questions. Along with your initial post, you are also required to respond to at least two (2) of your peers’ comments. Response posts are usually due by the end of the week in question: in this case, since the course began on a Wednesday, posts will be due by the Tuesday of the following week.\nIndividual Papers\nEach of you will write two analytical papers, which are due on June 9 and July 7 respectively. For the second paper assignment, you have the option to do a creative project (instead of a paper) using either BCS or Postmodernism concepts. Detailed instructions of the assignments are posted on Canvas. Feel free to consult with me if you have questions about an assignment or think you need extra help.\nResponse Papers\nYou will write two response papers responding to assigned films (see syllabus) in the contexts of the assigned readings. Each response paper should be approximately 750-1,000 words in length (3-4 pages, double-spaced). Your grade depends on how well you analyze and critique the film and how well you incorporate the readings into your critique/analysis.\nThe grading scale for papers is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nThis is excellent scholarly work that could be published in a student film or media studies journal. It displays good structure (i.e., a strong original thesis statement and a logical development of points to follow), content (sound analysis and good research when applicable), and presentational skills (i.e., excellence in verbal, logical, and grammatical expression, as well as care in mechanical details such as spelling, typing, bibliography and footnote preparation, etc.). It also follows style and formatting rules. (A=95).\n\n\nB\nThis is good scholarly work that could be published in a student journal with some adjustments. It has minor problems in a couple of the aforementioned areas. (B=85)\n\n\nC\nThis work exhibits problems in several of the aforementioned areas or a major problem in one. (C=75)\n\n\nD\nThis work exhibits little understanding of the subject matter or paper requirements. It fails to follow rudimentary formatting and displays sloppiness in spelling, grammar and sourcing. (D=65)\n\n\nF\nThis work exhibits no understanding of the subject matter or paper requirements. It fails to follow rudimentary formatting and displays sloppiness in spelling, grammar and sourcing. (F=55)"

    "text": "Generative Media: History, Theory, Practice\nThe concept of “generative” media has today become synonymous with generative AI, from chatbots to image and music synthesis.\nAlthough the term “generative” is today often treated as synonymous with AI-based artistic practices, generative art and aesthetics long predates the digital era, with antecedents that include the experiments with musical chance of John Cage and Lamonte Young, the early computational art of the 1960s, fractal images and music in the 1970s, or the ambient music of Brian Eno. The popularization of algorithmic tools that enable images, music, literary works, animation, and motion graphics to be generated from text and image prompts, however, has led to a surge in interest in code-based and algorithmic forms of creativity, along with debates about the aesthetic and ethical legitimacy of AI-generated artworks and other creative content. While computational art has been able to pass as human since the 1960s, the current explosive growth of algorithmic tools has rekindled aesthetic debates about the technological dimension of art and the relationship of art to the human more generally.\nThis course explores the history of generative approaches in the media arts, as well as changing social attitudes towards these and the contemporary debate swirling around “AI art.” In addition to historical examples and philosophical dimensions, students are introduced to a variety of generative approaches to artistic creativity, and collaborate on producing generative artworks in a medium of their choice using a variety of tools, frameworks, and platforms.\nTopic 1: Why Generative Media?\nTopic 2: Furniture Music\nTopic 3: John Cage and Lamonte Young\nTopic 4: From OULIPO to NaNoGenMo\nTopic 5: Computer Art\nTopic 6: Fractal Images, Music, Movies\nTopic 7: Oblique Strategies (Brian Eno) (including the movie)\nTopic 8: Procedural Videogames (Minecraft)\nTopic 9: Generative AI: Image\nTopic 10: Generative: AI Music\nTopic 11: Generative AI: Movies\nTopic 12: Faces: From Deepfakes to LivePortrait\nTopic 13: Generative AI: Realtime Performance\nTopic 14: Presentations"
